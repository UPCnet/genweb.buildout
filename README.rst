Genweb Uber-buildout
====================

This is the ultimate-uber-maxi-definitive-awesomefull buildout for Genweb-based
projects.

Usage
-----

You should choose what project do you want to work with or the basis of your new
one. For example, if you want to use a GenwebUPC buildout you should specify the
name of the project .cfg associated:

    ./bin/buildout -c genwebupc.cfg

Check out for the available projects in the projects.cfg file.

.. note:: Before that, remember to rename the customizeme.cfg.in file into customizeme.cfg configuring the required parameters.
